The core idea: what if a furniture manufacturer could walk into a showroom, snap a photo, and instantly generate a fully explorable 3D environment? What if a product designer could turn an early-stage prototype into a navigable virtual scene — on the fly, from their phone?\n\nThat\'s what this app does. It bridges Apple\'s LiDAR spatial reconstruction, native Object Capture photogrammetry, and World Labs\' generative AI into a single pipeline. Product Capture lets you 3D-scan real objects. World Gen lets you upload any image — a room, a product, a sketch — and the app calls the World Labs API to generate an immersive 3D world from it.\n\nWith the rate of burgeoning AI and spatial computing technology, I dove headfirst into agentic software development in February 2025 — building this app as a proof-of-concept for what the next generation of creative tools looks like for the industries I know best.'

One photo in, one navigable world out.\n\nThe example below was generated from the following image. I gave the app zero additional context — no text prompt, no room dimensions, no style guidance.
